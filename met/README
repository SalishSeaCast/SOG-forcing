		       Susan's Notes 20-Jul-06

Plan: From Jan 01, 2001 to Apr 2, 2003 use the data provided to SEA in
April 2003.  From Apr 3, 2003 to end, use Kate's data changing the
time to LST.

atemp.del, hum.del, cf.del created from sallen.del by splitting the
file up in emacs.

atemp.dat, hum.dat, cf.dat created from the .del files by changing ;
to space and removing "M"'s

CompositeMet combines the data, fills the SEA data, changes the time
on Kate's data

Changed one humidity point by hand Jan 8, 2006 2 LST from 12.3 to
91.0.

	     Doug's Notes on processRawYVRData.py Script
			      27-Jul-06

processRawYVRData.py reads a TEXT_HOURLIES file and produces cloud
fraction, humidity, and air temperature forcing data files for SOG.

processRawYVRData.py -h 

gives an explanation of command line options.  Self-test mode is not
yet operational.

The results files:
    cf_yvrTestResult.dat
    hum_yvrTestResult.dat
    atemp_yvrTestResult.dat
were produced by running processRawYVRData.py on yvrTestData.dat, a
doctored extract from 2 of the TEXT_HOURLIES files that triggers all
of the error conditions in processRawYVRData.py, as well as producing
some slightly convincing looking output.  

yvrTestErrors.txt is the list of errors (captured from stderr) that
the test data produces.

yvrTeststdout.txt is the stdout that the test data produces.
